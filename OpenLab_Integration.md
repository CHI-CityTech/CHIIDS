Integration of GitHub with OpenLab

Purpose: to identify those components that are best suited for each part of the CHIIDS structure.  Since part of CHIIDS is external integration, the lowest hanging fruit would be to consider OpenLab an external resoure that is integrated.  At its tightest, then we identify those parts of Open Lab that can best support the requirements of tCHIIDS
