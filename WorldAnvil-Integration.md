# WorldAnvil Integration with GitHub for CHIIDS

This proposal outlines a structured workflow for integrating WorldAnvil into CHIIDS with GitHub for project version control and proposal evaluation. By leveraging GitHub’s project management capabilities alongside WorldAnvil’s world-building platform, we can manage multiple researchers’ contributions effectively while maintaining oversight.

## Proposed Workflow

### 1. Centralized Repository for Proposals on GitHub
- All new proposals or major changes to the WorldAnvil world (e.g., new regions, characters, lore) are first documented as proposals on GitHub.
- Researchers submit proposals in structured formats (e.g., markdown documents) within GitHub, allowing transparent tracking, discussion, and collaborative input before implementation in WorldAnvil.

### 2. Review and Approval Process Using GitHub Issues & Pull Requests
- Each proposal is associated with a GitHub Issue or Pull Request, allowing team members to comment, suggest modifications, and discuss feasibility.
- Major updates go through a formal review cycle where key stakeholders approve, reject, or request modifications. GitHub’s approval settings ensure that only validated proposals move forward.

### 3. WorldAnvil as the Final Repository for Validated Content
- Approved proposals are moved to WorldAnvil, which serves as the “live” repository for validated entries.
- Metadata tags or notes can be added in WorldAnvil to indicate the GitHub version number, ensuring traceability between proposals and final entries.

### 4. Version Control and Historical Tracking on GitHub
- GitHub serves as the historical record, tracking all proposed changes, previous iterations, and associated discussions.
- For large updates, branches on GitHub can house “development” versions, which are consolidated into WorldAnvil upon final approval.

### 5. Regular Synchronization between GitHub and WorldAnvil
- A regular synchronization process is established, ensuring updates on WorldAnvil and GitHub are cross-referenced.
- Automation tools (like GitHub Actions) can notify team members to review changes on either platform or create reminders for syncing content updates.

### 6. Feedback and Iteration through GitHub Projects
- GitHub Projects manage world-building “sprints” or tasks, tracking each phase from proposal to final entry.
- Proposals are iteratively improved based on feedback, reducing disruptive changes on WorldAnvil.

### 7. Separate Repositories for Content Categories or Teams
- For complex projects, separate GitHub repositories or folders organize proposals by category (e.g., “Geography,” “Culture,” “Mythology”), facilitating focused discussions and workload division.

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

- **Content Synchronization Complexity**: Developing or using automation tools to synchronize metadata between GitHub and WorldAnvil can ensure both platforms reflect current information.
- **User Access and Permissions**: Assign WorldAnvil roles that align with GitHub permissions, with only approved members updating WorldAnvil directly.
- **Tracking Changes Across Platforms**: Adding metadata tags (e.g., GitHub Issue numbers) on WorldAnvil entries or using links back to GitHub in WorldAnvil entries ensures traceability.

## Example Workflow for a New Proposal

1. **Proposal Submission**: A researcher submits a proposal on GitHub for a new cultural element, such as a philosophical system.
2. **Team Review**: The team reviews, comments, and suggests changes on GitHub. Additional materials (e.g., references, sketches) are uploaded as part of the proposal.
3. **Approval and Migration**: Upon approval, the final version is moved to WorldAnvil, tagged with relevant metadata and links to the GitHub proposal.
4. **Closing the Proposal**: The GitHub proposal is closed, and future updates or iterations of that entry are documented through new issues or pull requests, maintaining a full history of changes.

## Benefits of this Approach

- **Clear Versioning and Accountability**: GitHub’s version control and project management tools provide a structured way to track changes and approve new content, reducing errors on WorldAnvil.
- **Collaborative Workflow**: Researchers can collaborate, provide feedback, and refine proposals before they become part of the world, ensuring higher-quality entries.
- **Seamless Integration and Organization**: By using WorldAnvil as the “live” repository and GitHub as the proposal space, CHIIDS can benefit from both platforms’ strengths without overcomplicating the workflow.

This approach enables a controlled, structured, and collaborative way to develop world-building content in WorldAnvil, ensuring that all changes are vetted, documented, and traceable through GitHub.
